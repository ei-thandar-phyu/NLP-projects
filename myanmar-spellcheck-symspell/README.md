# Spelling Correction for Myanmar Text Using SymSpell

This project explores the use of [SymSpell](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell) algorithm for correcting spelling errors in Myanmar text. It is inspired by the paper titled [SymSpell4Burmese](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9678171), which applies the Symmetric Delete Spelling Correction technique to the Myanmar language.

We conducted testing on a small set of manually selected sentences containing common spelling errors. The system successfully corrected various typographical errors such as ·Äü·ÄØ·Äê·Ä≠, ·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∞·Ä∏, and ·Äí·ÄÆ·Ä±·Äî·Äº. It also handled some phonetic errors (e.g., correcting ·Äï·Äê·Ä∫·Äû·Äê·Ä∫), though corrections that require contextual understanding remain challenging. Additionally, the system struggles with informal or non-standard language often found on social media, including slang and abbreviations.

For improved results, consider using context-aware neural models such as BERT-based spell checkers, Seq2Seq models, or Transformer-based approaches that better capture semantics and context in Myanmar text.

## Features

- Script for building frequency dictionaries from raw text
- Jupyter Notebook demo included


## Install dependencies:

```
pip install symspellpy
```

## Data Preparation

- Dataset used in this project will be uploaded soon at the following link:

- Preprocessing includes:
	- Removing extra spaces, punctuation, and emojis.
	- Word segmentation using myWord: Syllable, Word and Phrase Segmenter for Burmese.

## Frequency Dictionary Creation

Use [build_dict.py](https://github.com/ei-thandar-phyu/NLP-projects/blob/main/myanmar-spellcheck-symspell/build_dict.py) to generate unigram and bigram frequency dictionaries.

### Unigram Dictionary

You can optionally include a pre-existing Myanmar dictionary file such as [myG2p](https://github.com/ye-kyaw-thu/myG2P/blob/master/ver2/myg2p.ver2.0.txt).

```
# Without dictionary file
python build_dict.py -i corpus.txt -o unigram_dict.txt -t unigram

# With dictionary file
python build_dict.py -i corpus.txt -o unigram_dict.txt -t unigram -d myg2p.ver2.0.txt
```

### Bigram Dictionary

```
python build_dict.py -i corpus.txt -o bigram_dict.txt -t bigram
```

### Sample Output
Unigram Dictionary
```
·Äô·Äº·Äî·Ä∫·Äô·Ä¨ 2446
·Äû·Ä∞·ÄÑ·Äö·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏ 647
·ÄÖ·ÄÄ·Äº·Äù·Ä†·Ä¨ 57
```

Bigram Dictionary
```
·Äô·Äº·Äî·Ä∫·Äô·Ä¨ ·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂ 671
·Äõ·Äæ·Ä≠ ·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏ 495
·Äú·Ä∞·ÄÑ·Äö·Ä∫ ·Äê·ÄΩ·Ä± 144
```

### Running Spell Correction

- Open the jupyter notebook: [MMSpellCorrect_SymSpell.ipynb](https://github.com/ei-thandar-phyu/NLP-projects/blob/main/myanmar-spellcheck-symspell/MMSpellCorrect_SymSpell.ipynb)
- Load the generated frequency dictionaries
- Perform correction using SymSpellMyanmar 
- View corrected output
